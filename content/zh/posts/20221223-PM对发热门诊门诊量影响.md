Abstract
*Introduction:* While many studies have investigated the adverse effects of particulate matter (PM), few of them distinguished the different effects of PM2.5, PM10, and coarse PM (PMc) on outpatients with fever. Our study aimed to estimate and compare the acute cumulative effects of exposure to three size-specific particles on the number of visits to outpatient fever clinics.

*Methods:* To examine the association between daily PM concentrations and outpatients in fever clinics, a generalized additive Poisson model was applied, stratified by sex, age, and season.

*Results:* Our study included 56,144 outpatient visits in Zhuhai, from January 2020 to June 2021. On the current day, each 10 mg/m3 increment of PM10 and PMc were estimated to increase fever clinic visits by 1.74% (95% CI: 0.59%, 2.91%) and 4.42 % (2.30%, 6.58%), respectively. Cumulative effects enhanced from lag01 to lag05 for PM10 and PMc, and PMc had the strongest impact [ER = 8.92% (5.91%, 12.01%) at lag05]. Female outpatients and outpatients aged 14 years and above had an increased PM-related risk. During the cold season, significant effects could be observed for the three-size PM, while only PMc showed the impact during the warm season.

*Discussion:* Overall, the three size-specific PM exerted different effects on the fever clinic visits. Strategies to control the concentrations of PM are still necessary, especially against PM10 and PMc.

*引言：* 尽管许多研究已经调查了颗粒物（PM）的不良影响，但很少有研究区分了PM2.5、PM10和粗颗粒物（PMc）对发热门诊患者的不同影响。我们的研究旨在估计和比较暴露于三种尺寸特异性颗粒物对门诊发热诊所就诊人次的急性累积影响。

*方法：* 为了检查每日PM浓度与发热门诊患者之间的关联，我们应用了广义加性泊松模型，并根据性别、年龄和季节进行分层。

*结果：* 我们的研究包括了2020年1月至2021年6月珠海市56,144次门诊就诊。在当天，PM10和PMc每增加10 mg/m3，预计发热诊所就诊人次分别增加1.74%（95% CI：0.59%，2.91%）和4.42%（2.30%，6.58%）。从lag01到lag05，PM10和PMc的累积效应增强，其中PMc的影响最强[ER = 8.92%（5.91%，12.01%）在lag05]。女性门诊患者和14岁及以上的门诊患者的PM相关风险增加。在寒冷季节，三种尺寸的PM都有显著影响，而在温暖季节，只有PMc显示出影响。

*讨论：* 总的来说，三种尺寸特异性PM对发热门诊就诊人次产生了不同的影响。控制PM浓度的策略仍然是必要的，尤其是针对PM10和PMc。
