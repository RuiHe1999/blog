Semantic distances between lexical concepts in psychosis narrow and such narrowing co-occurs with increased perplexity at the sentence level.

_**Abstract**_

Speech in psychosis has long been ascribed as involving ‘loosening of associations’. We pursued the aim to elucidate its underlying cognitive mechanisms by analysing picture descriptions from 94 subjects (29 healthy controls, 18 participants at clinical high risk, 29 with first-episode psychosis, and 18 with chronic schizophrenia), using five language models with different computational architectures: FastText, which represents meaning non-contextually/statically; BERT, which represents contextual meaning sensitive to grammar and context; Infersent and SBERT, which provide sentential representations; and CLIP, which evaluates speech relative to a visual stimulus. These models were used to quantify semantic distances crossed between successive tokens/sentences, and semantic perplexity indicating unexpectedness in continuations. Results showed that, among patients, semantic similarity increased when measured with FastText, Infersent, and SBERT, while it decreased with CLIP and BERT. Higher perplexity was observed in first-episode psychosis. Static semantic measures were associated with clinically measured impoverishment of thought and referential semantic measures with disorganization. These patterns indicate a shrinking conceptual semantic space as represented by static language models, which co-occurs with a widening in the referential semantic space as represented by contextual models. This duality underlines the need to separate these two forms of meaning for understanding mechanisms involved in semantic change in psychosis.
