## Abstract
It is known that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) influences the temporal characteristics of spontaneous speech. These phonetical changes are present even in mild AD. Based on this, the question arises whether an examination based on language analysis could help the early diagnosis of AD and if so, which language and speech characteristics can identify AD in its early stage. The purpose of this article is to summarize the relation between prodromal and manifest AD and language functions and language domains. Based on our research, we are inclined to claim that AD can be more sensitively detected with the help of a linguistic analysis than with other cognitive examinations. The temporal characteristics of spontaneous speech, such as speech tempo, number of pauses in speech, and their length are sensitive detectors of the early stage of the disease, which enables an early simple linguistic screening for AD. However, knowledge about the unique features of the language problems associated with different dementia variants still has to be improved and refined.

# Questions Unsolved
If semantic issues matter that much in AD, how or whether could we identify AD from semantic dementia?

# Relationship between language and cognitive functions

1.	language features
-	semantic knowledge, e.g. naming, verbal fluency, object recognition ...
-	lexical semantic memory
2.	language functions
-	Deficits in language and memory functions, esp. semantic memory are commonly found in AD patients, even in early stage like amnesic MCI.
-	During the course of the whole memory decline, the impairment of language functions may begin before the stage of AD but as early as at least the stage of MCI.
-	During the total course of this disease, language seems to be impaired disproportionally. Semantic and pragmatic functions are more impaired and typically present in mild AD stage but articulatory and syntactic functions remain intact until the late stage of AD.

# Neural bases
Medial perirhinal cortex (mPRC) damage in very early AD may be detectable with common clinical tests of semantic memory if episodic memory performance is controlled.
