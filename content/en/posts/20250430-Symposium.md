I presented the coherence study at the symposium!“The Neuroscience of Language in Psychosis: A Diverse Global Perspective from the DISCOURSE Consortium.” Funded by the [Delta-Lang](https://www.upf.edu/web/grac/projects/-/asset_publisher/zECJ1F20hfHI/content/delta-lang/maximized) project, the study explores semantic and neural markers of (in)coherence in both typical and psychotic speech.
