Learning outcomes: (1) Machine learning based on automatically extracted language features detected cognitive decline from early stages of the AD continuum in a new Spanish-Catalan dataset. (2) Different speech and language domains showed differential discrimination performance between groups, with features extracted directly from speech performing better than those from the text. (3) Before the onset of objective cognitive impairment, speech and language from older adults with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) showed speech and language differences from controls without SCD, indicating potential heterogeneity in these non-clinical groups.
