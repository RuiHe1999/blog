I attended the 2025 DISCOURSE Consortium Satellite Meeting in Chicago, where I worked also as a member of the planning committee. It was a truly fantastic experience â€” an honor to take part and enjoy a number of outstanding posters and talks!

I gave an oral presentation on the PANSS prediction project, a collaborative effort involving around ten research groups. The study aims to develop a cross-lingual, fully automated model for predicting PANSS symptom scores from spontaneous speech using audio data only. It is supported by the [TRUSTING](https://www.upf.edu/web/grac/projects/-/asset_publisher/zECJ1F20hfHI/content/trusting/maximized) project.
