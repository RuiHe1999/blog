After SIRS 2024, I travelled from Florence to Pavia to attend the satellite meeting of the [DISCOURSE in Psychosis](https://discourseinpsychosis.org/) consortium. I presented a poster, which is available [here](https://github.com/RuiHe1999/blog/blob/main/Files/pavia_80_120.pdf).

Great meetings and talks there! Look forward to the satellite meeting next year.
