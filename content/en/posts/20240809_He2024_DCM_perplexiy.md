_**Abstract**_

**Background:** Psychosis involves a distortion of thought content, which is partly reflected in anomalous ways in which words are semantically connected into utterances in speech. We sought to explore how these linguistic anomalies are realized through putative circuit-level abnormalities in the brain's semantic network.

**Methods:** Using a computational large-language model, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), we quantified the contextual expectedness of a given word sequence (perplexity) across 180 samples obtained from descriptions of 3 pictures by patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) and controls matched for age, parental social status, and sex, scanned with 7 T ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Subsequently, perplexity was used to parametrize a spectral dynamic causal model (DCM) of the effective connectivity within (intrinsic) and between (extrinsic) 4 key regions of the semantic network at rest, namely the anterior temporal lobe, the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the posterior middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and the angular gyrus.

**Results:** We included 60 participants, including 30 patients with FES and 30 controls. We observed higher perplexity in the FES group, indicating that speech was less predictable by the preceding context among patients. Results of Bayesian model comparisons showed that a DCM including the group by perplexity interaction best explained the underlying patterns of neural activity. We observed an increase of self-inhibitory effective connectivity within the IFG, as well as reduced self-inhibitory tone within the pMTG, in the FES group. An increase in self-inhibitory tone in the IFG correlated strongly and positively with inter-regional excitation between the IFG and posterior MTG, while self-inhibition of the posterior MTG was negatively correlated with this interregional excitation.

**Limitation:** Our design did not address connectivity in the semantic network during tasks that selectively activated the semantic network, which could corroborate findings from this resting-state fMRI study. Furthermore, we do not present a replication study, which would ideally use speech in a different language.

**Conclusion:** As an explanation for peculiar speech in psychosis, these results index a shift in the excitatory-inhibitory balance regulating information flow across the semantic network, confined to 2 regions that were previously linked specifically to the executive control of meaning. Based on our approach of combining a large language model with causal connectivity estimates, we propose loss in semantic control as a potential neurocognitive mechanism contributing to disorganization in psychosis.
