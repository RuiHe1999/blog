## Bio

I was born in China. I obtained my bachelor’s degree in translation at Jinan University (Guangzhou, China) and my master’s degree in theoretical and applied linguistics with the specialization in computational linguistics at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona, Spain). I am now a doctoral candidate with Universitat Pompeu Fabra studying how to model and predict language and memory decline in Alzheimer’s disease using machine learning technique. This study is supervised by Dr. [Wolfram Hinzen](https://sites.google.com/site/wolframhinzen/) and Dr. [Núria Bel](https://www.upf.edu/web/nuria-bel). This project is granted by [China Scholarship Council (CSC)](https://www.cscse.edu.cn/).

I worked as an intern with the NLP team in the AI Lab of ByteDance, the comprehensive/statistic office of Zhuhai People’s Hospital, and the translation group of Belink Translation. I am a part-time translator with specialist translation areas of business advertising; healthcare and medicine; certification, testing, inspection; international relations; and investment.

## Research interests 

I am in developing trustworthy natural language processing tool for healthcare. Currently, I am working on computational modeling and prediction of language and memory decline in Alzheimer’s disease.
