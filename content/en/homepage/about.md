## Bio

I was born in Hubei, China, and moved to Zhuhai to obtain my BA degree in translation at [School of Translation Studies, Jinan University](https://translation.jnu.edu.cn/). That was also the period when I interned in the comprehensive office of Zhuhai People’s Hospital and particiapted in several public health studies. After that, I pursued a master's in theoretical and applied linguistics with a specialization in computational linguistics at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona, Spain)](https://www.upf.edu/). During the program, I built and evaluated a neural network for metaphor detection under the supervision of Dr. Núria Bel. Later, I shifted my focus to applied natural language processing in cognitive disorders. That motivated me to join [GraC](https://www.upf.edu/web/grac) at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra as a doctoral candidate, where I am studying how to model language and brain changes computationally in cognitive disorders. This study started with a focus on Alzheimer’s disease but has since expanded to other types of dementia (progressive primary aphasia for example) and schizophrenia. My doctoral study is supervised by Dr. [Wolfram Hinzen](https://www.upf.edu/web/grac/members/-/asset_publisher/2vKho4JmnLlS/content/hinzen-wolfram/maximized) and Dr. [Núria Bel](https://www.upf.edu/web/nuria-bel), and granted by [China Scholarship Council (CSC)](https://www.cscse.edu.cn/).  

## Research interests 
My interest generally falls into how language and brain function changes in cognitively atypical population using automatized approaches, and further into how changes in these two domains connects to each other. My current research majorly investigates two disease spectra, dementia and schizophrenia. Knowledge acquired from such analyses would serve as an input to the development of trustworthy language-based automatic predictive tools for disease warning. 

## Key words
