I have provided my downloadable resume here. It is an online version created using Overleaf (XeLaTeX). A PDF version has been automatically generated and is displayed in the right column, eliminating the need for familiarity with LaTeX/Overleaf. If you wish to download it, simply click the "â¤“" download button located in the top bar. For those interested in learning more about Overleaf, tutorials can be found at https://www.overleaf.com/learn. After spending approximately 30 minutes reading these tutorials, you will gain a fundamental understanding of Overleaf. I would like to acknowledge that this resume was created using the template generously shared by Christian Maria Giannetti at https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/elegant-resume-template/gcnbfnxkcwby. Many thanks for their contributions.
